# GCD Thresholding for Image Segmentation

## Overview

GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) Thresholding is a novel technique devised for segmenting images by determining an optimal threshold value based on the GCD of pixel intensities within the image. This technique aims to provide an innovative approach to image segmentation by leveraging mathematical properties derived from pixel values.

## Technique Description

### 1. GCD Calculation

- **Pixel Intensity Analysis:** Calculate the GCD of pixel intensities within the image matrix.
- **Threshold Determination:** Utilize the GCD value as a threshold for image segmentation.

### 2. Segmentation Process

- **Threshold Application:** Compare pixel intensities with the determined GCD threshold.
- **Binary Segmentation:** Classify pixels as foreground or background based on the threshold.

### 3. Image Enhancement

- **Post-segmentation Processing:** Apply morphological operations or additional filters for image refinement.

## Installation and Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Image processing libraries (e.g., OpenCV, PIL)
